## How to Add Your Wedding Card Background Image

**IMPORTANT:** Copy your wedding card background image here as `bg.png`

### Steps:
1. Copy your wedding card image (from `app/public/bg.png` or your source)
2. Paste it here: `public/bg.png`
3. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG
4. Recommended size: 1920x1080 or higher for best quality

### Current Location:
- ❌ Wrong: `app/public/bg.png` (Next.js won't find it here)
- ✅ Correct: `public/bg.png` (Place your image here!)

Once added, refresh your browser to see the background!
